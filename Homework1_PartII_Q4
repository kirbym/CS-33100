/*
4.(Text Exercise 5.17) An online retailer sells five products whose retail prices are as follows:
Product 1, $2.98
Product 2, $4.50
Product 3, $9.98
Product 4, $4.49
Product 5, $6.87
Write an application that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows:
a)product number, and
b)quantity sold.
Your program should use a switch statement to determine the retail price for each product.
It should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold.
Use a sentinel-controlled loop to determine when the program should stop looping and display
the final results.

//and the quantity. The sale of the product will be calculated from the quantity entered and the predetermined price.
//The total retail value will be calculated by adding all the individual sales.
