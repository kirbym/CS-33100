// PartII_Q1.cpp

/*
1. (Text Exercise 2.28) Write a program that inputs a five-digit integer, separates the integer into 
its digits and prints them separated by three space each. [Hint: Use the integer division and 
remainder operators.] 
For example, if the user types in 42339, the program should print: 4   2   3   3   9
*/

//This program takes a five digit integer input from the user and separates the integer into its five digits.
//Using integer division, the digit for each place (ones place, tens place, etc.) will be found.
//Using the modulus operator, the five digit integer will be broken down into a four digit integer whereby
//the next digit will be found with integer division. Repeat to break four digit integer into three, etc.
